Description: Kernel-based SIIT and NAT64 (IP/ICMP translation)
	Jool is a couple of Netfilter kernel modules that convert the
	forwarding IPv4 traffic (of a given network namespace) to IPv6
	traffic and vice versa, according to a configurable IP address
	translation strategy.
	.
	The `jool_siit` module implements SIIT (sometimes known as "Stateless
	NAT64"), a lightweight translator that avoids storing state by
	keeping a deterministic 1-to-1 relationship between IPv4 addresses
	and their IPv6 counterparts. It can translate addresses using the
	"traditional prefix" algorithm defined in RFC 6052, and/or the
	Explicit Address Mapping algorithm defined in RFC 7757.
	.
	The `jool` module implements Stateful NAT64, a translator that can
	achieve 1 (IPv4)-to-N (IPv6) relationships through a mapping strategy
	based on stateful NAT. Its full address translation algorithm is
	defined in RFC 6146.
	.
	The jool-utils package contains the userspace configuration clients.

Description: Userspace configuration clients for the Jool kernel modules
	This package contains the userspace configuration clients that can
	be used to tweak the behavior of Jool's kernel modules.
	.
	The kernel modules can be found in the jool-dkms package.
